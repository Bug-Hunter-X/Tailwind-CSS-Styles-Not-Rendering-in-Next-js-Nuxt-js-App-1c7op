# Tailwind CSS Styles Not Rendering in Next.js/Nuxt.js App

This repository demonstrates a common bug where Tailwind CSS styles fail to render in Next.js or Nuxt.js applications, despite the classes appearing to be correctly implemented. The issue typically arises from misconfigurations in the project's build process or a discrepancy between how Tailwind CSS generates styles and how your components utilize them.

The `bug.js` file contains code that showcases the problem.  The `bugSolution.js` file offers the solution.  Solutions may involve updating the Tailwind configuration, ensuring correct imports, or verifying compatibility with the selected framework.
