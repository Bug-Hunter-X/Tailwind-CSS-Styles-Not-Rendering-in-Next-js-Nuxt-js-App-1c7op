The solution usually involves ensuring that your Next.js/Nuxt.js project is correctly configured to integrate with Tailwind CSS. Verify the following:

1. **Correct Tailwind Configuration:** Ensure that the `tailwind.config.js` (or equivalent for Nuxt.js) file is correctly set up and points to the correct CSS entry point. Check that `content` array includes the paths to your template files. 
2. **Purge or Build:** Ensure that Tailwind's `purge` option (or equivalent for the latest Tailwind version) is properly set up.  This feature removes unused styles.  If you're using a build process, ensure it's correctly configured to process and include the compiled Tailwind CSS files.
3. **CSS Import:** Make sure your main CSS file (usually `globals.css` or `styles.css`) correctly imports `tailwind.css`. 
4. **Framework Integration:** Make sure that your framework (Next.js or Nuxt.js) is set up to support Tailwind CSS. Consult your framework's documentation on the correct approach to integrate Tailwind.
5. **Restart and Clear Cache:** After making changes, ensure you fully restart your development server. Clear your browser's cache as well.

Example (Next.js):

```javascript
// pages/_app.js
import '../styles/globals.css'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```
```javascript
// styles/globals.css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

By addressing these points, the Tailwind CSS styles should render correctly in your application.
